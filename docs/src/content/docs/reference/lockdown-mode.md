**GitHub lockdown mode** is [a security feature of the GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/server-configuration.md#lockdown-mode) that filters content in public repositories to only surface items (issues, pull requests, comments, discussions, etc.) from users with **push access** to the repository. This protects agentic workflows from processing potentially malicious or misleading content from untrusted users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Workflows running on public repositories must be compiled with strict mode enabled. If `strict: false` is set in the frontmatter, the workflow will fail at runtime on public repositories. See [Strict Mode](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/#strict-mode-strict) for details.

## Automatic Minimum-Integrity Protection

For **public repositories** where the GitHub MCP server is configured **without** explicit `lockdown` or `min-integrity` guard policy settings, `min-integrity: approved` is automatically applied at runtime. This ensures the guardrail is always in place — even when additional authentication has not been configured.

`min-integrity: approved` restricts content to objects authored by owners, members, and collaborators (users with push access), providing the same level of content filtering as enabling lockdown mode explicitly.

- **Public repositories**: `min-integrity: approved` is applied automatically (same filtering level as explicit lockdown mode).
- **Private/internal repositories**: No guard policy is applied automatically (`min-integrity: none`).

The automatic guard policy does **not** apply when:
- An explicit `lockdown` or `min-integrity` value is set in the workflow frontmatter.
- A GitHub App token is configured (`tools.github.app`).

To override or disable the automatic guard policy, set an explicit value:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: none  # Disable automatic guard for public repo workflows that process all users
```

## Lockdown Mode (Content Filter)

To enable lockdown mode for your workflow:

1. **Set `lockdown: true` in your workflow frontmatter**
2. **Configure [Additional Authentication for GitHub Tools](/gh-aw/reference/github-tools/#additional-authentication-for-github-tools)

Lockdown Mode is **automatically enabled** for public repositories if [Additional Authentication for GitHub Tools](/gh-aw/reference/github-tools/#additional-authentication-for-github-tools) is configured. It is not in effect for private or internal repositories.

## Security Benefits

GitHub lockdown mode protects against several attack vectors:

### Input Manipulation

Without lockdown, an attacker could:

1. Create an issue with malicious code snippets or links
2. Trigger an agentic workflow (e.g., issue triage, planning assistant)
3. Attempt to hijack the workflow through prompt-injection

**With lockdown**: Only trusted contributors' issues are visible to workflows.

### Context Poisoning

Attackers could flood public repositories with spam issues to:

- Overwhelm the AI context window with noise
- Manipulate AI decisions through volume of malicious suggestions
- Exhaust rate limits or credits

**With lockdown**: Only legitimate contributor content consumes workflow resources.

### Social Engineering

Malicious users could craft issues that:

- Impersonate maintainers
- Request sensitive information
- Trick AI into revealing secrets or internal data

**With lockdown**: Only verified contributors can interact with workflows.

## Example

```yaml wrap
---
engine: copilot

tools:
  github:
    lockdown: true
    github-token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_TOKEN }}  # Required for lockdown, and causes lockdown in public repos
    mode: remote
    toolsets: [repos, issues, pull_requests]
---

# Your workflow that requires lockdown protection
```

```bash
# Configure the required token
gh aw secrets set GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN --value "YOUR_FINE_GRAINED_PAT"
```

## Disabling Lockdown Mode

Explicitly disable lockdown for workflows designed to process content from all users:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    lockdown: false  # Explicitly disable (see "When to Disable" below)
```

## When to Disable Lockdown

If working in a public repository, it is recommended that you use an explicit `lockdown: true` or `lockdown: false`.

Some workflows are **designed** to process content from all users and include appropriate safety controls. Safe use cases for `lockdown: false` in public repositories:

- **Issue Triage**: Workflows that label, categorize, or route issues from all users
- **Issue Organization**: Workflows that add issues to projects or milestones based on labels or content
- **Issue Planning**: Workflows that estimate complexity, suggest related issues, or draft implementation plans based on issue content
- **Spam Detection**: Workflows that identify and flag spam issues or comments
- **Public Dashboards**: Workflows that generate public reports or metrics based on all repository activity
- **Command Workflows**: Workflows that respond to specific commands in issue comments (e.g., `/plan`, `/analyze`) and verify user permissions before taking action
