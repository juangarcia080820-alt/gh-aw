[Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) is an MCP server that enhances AI agents with IDE-like tools for semantic code analysis and manipulation. It supports **30+ programming languages** through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration, enabling agents to find symbols, navigate code relationships, and edit at the symbol level — ideal for navigating and editing large, well-structured codebases.

> [!CAUTION]
> `tools.serena` has been removed. Use the `shared/mcp/serena.md` shared workflow instead (see [Migration](#migration-from-toolsserena) below). Workflows that still use `tools.serena` will fail to compile.

## Quick Start

### Recommended: Import shared workflow

The preferred way to add Serena is to import the shared workflow, which configures the complete MCP server automatically:

```aw wrap
---
on: issues
engine: copilot
permissions:
  contents: read
imports:
  - uses: shared/mcp/serena.md
    with:
      languages: ["go", "typescript"]
---
```

For Go-only workflows, use the convenience wrapper:

```aw wrap
---
on: issues
engine: copilot
permissions:
  contents: read
imports:
  - shared/mcp/serena-go.md
---
```

### Example: Code Analysis

```aw wrap
---
engine: copilot
permissions:
  contents: read
imports:
  - uses: shared/mcp/serena.md
    with:
      languages: ["go"]
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [default]
---

# Code Quality Analyzer

Analyze Go code for quality improvements:
1. Find all exported functions and check for missing documentation
2. Identify code patterns and suggest improvements
```

## Migration from `tools.serena`

Replace `tools.serena` with the equivalent import:

```yaml title="Before (removed)"
tools:
  serena: ["go", "typescript"]
```

```aw wrap title="After (recommended)"
imports:
  - uses: shared/mcp/serena.md
    with:
      languages: ["go", "typescript"]
```

The shared workflow configures the full Serena MCP server (container image, entrypoint, workspace mount) explicitly. Compiling a workflow that still uses `tools.serena` now fails with an error:

```
✖ 'tools.serena' has been removed. Use the shared/mcp/serena.md workflow instead:
  imports:
    - uses: shared/mcp/serena.md
      with:
        languages: ["go", "typescript"]
```

## Language Support

Serena supports **30+ programming languages** through Language Server Protocol (LSP):

| Category | Languages |
|----------|-----------|
| **Systems** | C, C++, Rust, Go, Zig |
| **JVM** | Java, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy (partial) |
| **Web** | JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Elm |
| **Dynamic** | Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Lua |
| **Functional** | Haskell, Elixir, Erlang, Clojure, OCaml |
| **Scientific** | R, Julia, MATLAB, Fortran |
| **Shell** | Bash, PowerShell |
| **Other** | C#, Swift, Nix, Markdown, YAML, TOML |

> [!NOTE]
> Some language servers require additional dependencies. Most are automatically installed by Serena, but check the [Language Support](https://oraios.github.io/serena/01-about/020_programming-languages.html) documentation for specific requirements.

## Available Tools

Serena provides semantic code tools organized into three categories:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Symbol Navigation** | `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `get_symbol_definition`, `list_symbols_in_file` |
| **Code Editing** | `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_after_symbol`, `insert_before_symbol`, `delete_symbol` |
| **Project Analysis** | `find_files`, `get_project_structure`, `analyze_imports` |

These tools enable agents to work at the **symbol level** rather than the file level, making code operations more precise and context-aware.

## Usage Examples

### Find Unused Functions

```aw wrap
---
engine: copilot
imports:
  - shared/mcp/serena-go.md
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [default]
---

# Find Unused Code

1. Configure memory: `mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/serena`
2. Use `find_symbol` and `find_referencing_symbols` to identify unused exports
3. Report findings
```

## Best Practices

Pre-create the cache directory (`mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/serena`) for faster operations — Serena reuses language server indexes across runs. Pin the key with `tools.cache-memory.key: serena-analysis` in frontmatter to persist it. Prefer symbol-level operations (`replace_symbol_body`) over file-level edits. Combine Serena with other tools like `github`, `edit`, and `bash` for complete workflows. For large codebases, start with targeted analysis of specific packages before expanding scope.

## Troubleshooting

**Language server not found:** Install required dependencies (e.g., `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` for Go).

**Memory permission issues:** Ensure cache directory exists with proper permissions: `mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/serena && chmod 755 /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/serena`

**Slow initial analysis:** Expected behavior as language servers build indexes. Subsequent runs use cached data.
