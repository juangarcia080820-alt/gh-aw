## QMD MCP Server

Provides the QMD MCP server for on-device documentation search over the project docs,
agent definitions, and workflow authoring instructions.

QMD (Query Markup Documents) is a local search engine that combines BM25 full-text
search, vector semantic search, and LLM re-ranking — all running locally via
node-llama-cpp with GGUF models.

This shared configuration indexes three collections and starts a local HTTP
MCP server for the agent to query:

- `docs` — `docs/src/content/docs/` (documentation guides and reference)
- `agents` — `.github/agents/` (custom agent definitions and instructions)
- `aw` — `.github/aw/` (workflow authoring instructions and templates)

### Available Tools

- **`query`** — Search with typed sub-queries
  - Supports `lex` (BM25 keyword), `vec` (semantic), and `hyde` (LLM-expanded) query types
  - Combined via RRF + reranking for best quality
  - Parameters: `query` (string), `collections` (optional), `limit` (optional)

- **`get`** — Retrieve a specific document by path or docid
  - Supports fuzzy matching suggestions when path is not found
  - Parameters: `path` (string, e.g. `"docs/guides/getting-started.md"` or `"#abc123"`)

- **`multi_get`** — Batch retrieve by glob pattern or comma-separated list
  - Parameters: `pattern` (string, e.g. `"docs/reference/*.md"`)

- **`status`** — Index health and collection information
  - Returns collection names, document counts, and MCP server uptime

### Setup

Import this configuration in your workflow:

```yaml
imports:
  - shared/mcp/qmd-docs.md
```

### Example Usage

```yaml
---
on: workflow_dispatch
engine: copilot
imports:
  - shared/mcp/qmd-docs.md
---

# Documentation Search Workflow

Use the qmd tool to search the project documentation and answer questions.

1. Use `status` to see what collections are indexed
2. Use `query` with `lex` type for fast keyword search
3. Use `get` to retrieve specific documentation pages
```

### How It Works

The QMD index is pre-built by the `qmd-docs-indexer.yml` workflow on every trusted push
to `main` (path-filtered to the indexed directories) and on a daily schedule. This ensures
the index always reflects verified content.

At runtime (when this shared module is imported):

1. Node.js 24 is installed
2. QMD is installed globally from npm (`@tobilu/qmd`)
3. The pre-built qmd index is restored from `actions/cache` using a key derived from a hash of the docs, agents, and aw content
4. The HTTP MCP server starts on `localhost:8181`

The `query` tool supports BM25 full-text search (`lex` type) out of the box.
For semantic vector search (`vec`/`hyde` types), run `qmd embed` before starting
the server to generate local GGUF model embeddings.
